# py-payment - Template

This repository was created to be used in a Python project utilizing the Flask framework to create an payment visualization page with real-time notifications. The page is designed to notify the user when a payment is confirmed through another route in the Flask application. Here we have only the HTML and CSS of the template. The complete project can be found in another repository.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file defining the structure of the order visualization page.
- `style.css`: CSS file responsible for the styling and design of the page.
- `img/`: Folder containing images used in the project.
